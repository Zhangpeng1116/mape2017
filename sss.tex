\begin{abstract}
On-body propagation channels show significant polarization selectivity in static and dynamic scenarios. In this work, we measured polarized on-body channels on static body at 2.4 GHz by monopole antennas, where standing and sitting postures are considered. The polarization direction of the antenna (Z-polarization, H-polarization, V-polarization) depends on the the direction of the antenna in the body position. In the statistical characteristics of the channels, the V-polarization direction of the receiving antenna is more conducive to receiving signal and reducing the path losses. Cross-polar discrimination (XPD) are calculated from measurement data, the strongly depolarization of on-body channels is more easily caused by the human sitting posture due to legs scattering. No matter how the polarization direction of the transmission antenna , the receiving antenna can generally obtain a decent field component in the V-polarization direction.

\section{Introduction}
Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are a short distance communication, which makes the battery life cycle longer due to the short communication distance (\textless2m)\cite{1}. In recent years, WBANs have received a great attention owing to the increasing demand for the applications in health care and entertainment systems. Dynamic on-body communication channels have been studied\cite{2,3,4,5,6,7}. For further understand the characteristics of static human communication channels, narrow-band polarized on-body channel measurements are invest in this paper.\par
Through the statistical analysis of the measured data, it is found that the V-polarization direction of the receiving antenna can generally reduce transmission loss of the signal. Compared with the Z and H polarization direction of the receiving antenna, the receiver can obtain more signal waves and have a better polarization gain in the V-polarization direction. The characteristics of on-body channels depolarization show that the V-polarization direction of the receiving antenna has the advantage in capturing the field component.\par
This paper is organised as follows. The measurement settings are given in Section II. The statistical analysis of channel characteristics and de-polarization effects are presented in Section III. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section IV.

\section{Measurement Setup}
The measurement was carried out in indoor environment of a laboratory with dimension of 6 by 7 meters and no large obstacles around, two postures (standing or sitting) are investigated, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:1}(a). The selected human body model was male with a height of 160 cm and weight of 50 kg. VNA is set to 2.484 GHz continous wave frequency, the antenna is a vertical polarization monopole antenna. The specific settings of VNA and antenna are shown in Table \ref{tab:1}. The antennas were mounted 2cm above the body surface to avoid body coupling effect. The actual measured frequency is 2.484 GHz to avoid the intense usage of WiFi channels. We investigated five group of on-body channels, head-left shoulder channel (T-LS), head-left wrist (T-LW), chest-left abdomen (C-LA), left shoulder-chest (LS-C), and left elbow-left wrist (LE-LW), respectively. The key parts of the body such as the Fig.\ref{fig:1}(b), different combinations of which allow establishing useful communication links, such as a head-mounted display or a wrist-mounted input device. The impact of ground reflection is minimized due to these links in the upper half of the body.\par

For near-field propagation, the direction of field may not follow the vertical relationship with the propagation direction due to the interaction between the radiation source and the body scattering. This will cause field spreading in all directions. To facilitate the study of on-body channels, the antenna¡¯s orientation is defined relative to the body surface in 3 directions, vertical tangential to the body, denoted as Z, horizontal tangential to the body, denoted as H, vertical normal to the body, denoted as V. The polarizations are defined differently in different parts of the body because of the irregularity of the shape of the body, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:1}(c). Consequently, for one scenario investigated, the channel is measured in total of 9 polarization combinations, denoted as XY, \begin{math}X.Y\in\{Z,V,H\},\end{math} where X is the polarization of the transmit antenna and Y is the receiving antenna polarization. The measurements are found to maintain flat fading during the measurement, hence the mean of the channel is investigated.

\section{Measurement Statistical Analysis}

\subsection{Receiving V-polarization}
The average path loss of on-body channels in different polarization combinations are presented in the Table \ref{tab:2}. In the standing posture, the optimal polarization combination of T-LS and C-LA channels is VV, and the optimal polarization combination of T-LW, LS-C and LE-LW channels is ZV. In the sitting posture, the optimal polarization combination of the other channels does not change, except for the LE-LW channel (HH). This shows that the V-polarization direction of the receiving antenna may capture the major part of the signal waves. On the contrary, V-polarization is not found at the receiving side by analyzing the worst polarization combinations of on-body channels. Such as the worst combination of T-LS and C-LB channels is ZZ in the standing posture. Although the worst polarization combinations of the T-LW and LS-C channels contain the V-polarization direction in the sitting posture, it is not at the receiving side. These indicate that the V-polarization of the receiving antenna plays a significant role in reducing the path losses and effectively receiving signal.\par

Since the V-polarization direction making the antenna perpendicular to the body surface extending outward, which reduces the scattering of the body surface to the radiation source and the absorption of energy by the body. The Z and H polarization directions of the antenna maintain a parallel relationship with the human body, making the impact of body scattering on the radiation source is stronger than V direction. As a result, field propagating along the body surface will orient its field along the perpendicular direction than the other directions. The receiver in V-polarization can receive the  major part of the signal waves caused by the interaction between the body scattering and the field source.
\subsection{polarization gain}
To more specifically describe the advantages of the V-polarization of the receiving antenna, we define the gain of receiving V-polarization as
\begin{equation}\label{ep:1}
G_{R_{V}}=\frac{\sum\limits_I\sum\limits_J{\textbf{PL}(IJ)}}{6} -\frac{\sum\limits_I{\textbf{PL}(IV)}}{3}
\end{equation}
where \begin{math}I\in\{Z,H,V\}, J\in\{Z,H\}\end{math}, IJ and IV represent polarization combination, \textbf{PL}(IJ) is the path loss of IJ polarization combination, \textbf{PL}(IV) is the path loss of IV polarization combination.
The  V-polarization gain of each channel is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:2}. The V-polarization gain of the standing posture is better than that of sitting in each channel. The V-polarization gain of each on-body channel is at least 5dB in the standing posture. In addition, the gain of each channel can also reach at least 3dB in the sitting posture.
\subsection{Channel depolarization}
As the polarizations described in Section II were defined with respect to the body surface orientation at the antenna position. The body scattering effect leads to heavy cross polarization that will cause the field polarization become away from the polarization as defined. The de-polarization is studied by the following six scenarios. The change of the Z polarization into V and H directional components at the receive antenna can be characterized by comparing ZZ and ZV combinations (scenario ZZ-ZV), ZZ and ZH combinations (scenario ZZ-ZH). De-polarization from the V-polarization into Z and H polarization is characterized by VV and VZ combinations (scenario VV-VZ), VV and VH combinations (scenario VV-VH). Similarly, comparing the HH and HZ combinations (scenario HH-HZ), HH and HV combinations (scenario HH-HV), the change of the H-polarization into Z and V directional components at the receive antenna is described. The cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) for these six cases is defined here as the ratio of the corresponding co-polarized power to the corresponding cross-polarized power\cite{6}, which is given by
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
   XPD_{i,j}=10\lg{\frac{P_{ii}}{P_{ij}}}\quad [dB]
\end{equation}
where \begin{math}P_{ii}\end{math} is the co-polarized power, \begin{math}P_{ij}\end{math} is the cross-polarized power, \begin{math}i.j\in\{Z,V,H\}, i\neq{j}\end{math}.
The XPDs for each of the five measured channels are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:3}. The negative XPD indicates that the cross-polarization configurations remain dominant in these links, while the positive XPD indicates that the co-polarization configurations are dominant. The greater the absolute XPD, the stronger the dominant position of polarization configuration (cross-polarization or co-polarization). The channel is strongly depolarized when the XPD converge to 0dB.\par
The XPD of the standing posture is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:3}(a). The negative XPD of ZZ-ZV and ZZ-ZH scenarios shows the cross-polarized configurations remain dominant in all channels, and ZV combination is better suited to on-body channels than ZH combination because of the greater absolute XPD of ZZ-ZV scenario. The positive XPD of VV-VZ scenario shows VV combination remains dominate in each channel. On the other hand, the LE-LW channel is strongly depolarized in VV-VH and HH-HV scenarios, with the XPD nearly equal to 0dB. The XPD of the sitting posture is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:3}(b). Unlike the case of  the standing posture , we can find that there is the strongly depolarized channel in each scenario, for example, C-LA channel in ZZ-ZV scenario, LS-C channel in ZZ-ZH scenario and T-LS channel in VV-VH scenario. These show human sitting posture is more likely to cause depolarization of on-body channels due to the influence of the legs scattering.\par
In addition, we find that the XPD of the on-body propagation channels under the scenarios ZZ-ZV and HH-HV is generally negative and the XPD of the scenarios VV-VZ and VV-VH are generally positive values, regardless of the standing and sitting postures. These indicate that the receiving antenna can generally obtain the decent component of the field in the V-polarization direction, regardless of the polarization direction polarization of the transmission antenna. At the same time, this is also the reason why the receiving antenna with V- polarization can effectively receive signal and reduce the path loss.
\section{Conclusion}
Analysis of the measurements of static on-body propagation channels at 2.4 GHz demonstrate that V-polarization of the receiving antenna can effectively reduce the path loss and capture signal waves. The gain of receiving V-polarization of each channel can up to at least 3dB in the sitting posture, and the V-polarization gain of each on-body channel can up to at last 5dB in the standing posture. Depolarization of on-body channels is more serious in the sitting posture due to the effect of leg scattering. The receiving antenna with V-polarization is more beneficial to  obtain the decent field component compared with the Z and H polarization of the receiving antenna by analyzing the depolarization characteristics of static on-body channels, regardless of the polarization direction of the transmission antenna. This once again proved that the receiving antenna with V-polarization can effectively reduce the path loss.
